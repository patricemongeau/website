			CardStacks is a simple todo-list app developed by Patrice Mongeau.
			
			<p>
			With CardStacks, you can create stacks, and cards, and write whatever on them.

			<p>
			To get started, touch the + to make a new stack, and name it. You can make more stacks if you want. <br>
			Next, you can make cards in each stack, and edit, share or delete them by using the bottoms app icons.

			<p>
			For each stack, you can also reorganize your cards by dragging them right or left and by using the arrows. Tip: It's easier in landscape mode.
